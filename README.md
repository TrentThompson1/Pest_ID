## Description

This project uses machine learning techniques to identify 12 different agricultural pests.
It trains on 4,395 images of 12 different pests ranging from snails to moths, and then 
classifies the 1,099 images from the testing set. Our hope is that it may be used as an 
accessable tool for small scale farmers to identify pests so that they may take quicker and 
more informed actions.
